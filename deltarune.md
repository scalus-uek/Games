# Deltarune: A Journey Through Light and Dark

## Overview of the Game
Deltarune is an episodic role-playing game developed by Toby Fox, the creator of the cult-classic hit *Undertale*. While it features many familiar faces and shares a distinct visual style with its predecessor, the game takes place in a parallel universe with its own unique lore and mechanics. The story follows a human teenager named Kris and their classmate Susie, who stumble into a mysterious realm known as the "Dark World." There, they discover they are the "heroes of legend" destined to restore balance between light and dark by sealing Dark Fountains.

## The World and Story
The narrative is split between two primary settings: the "Light World," a quiet town called Hometown where Kris lives, and various "Dark Worlds" accessed through hidden portals. In the Dark World, objects from the real world—like playing cards, toys, or computer programs—manifest as sentient beings called Darkners. Unlike the underground setting of *Undertale*, the journey in *Deltarune* feels more like a grand fantasy quest, as the protagonists travel across diverse kingdoms to prevent a catastrophic event known as "The Roaring."

## Gameplay and Combat
Deltarune retains the iconic turn-based combat and "bullet hell" dodging mechanics of *Undertale*, but introduces a party system. Players control Kris and can issue commands to allies like Susie and Ralsei. The game emphasizes choice; players can choose to fight enemies or "Act" and "Spare" them to resolve conflicts peacefully. A key addition is the Tension Points (TP) bar, which is filled by grazing enemy bullets and can be spent on powerful magic spells or special "Dual Acts" with party members.

## Key Characters
The heart of the game lies in its cast of endearing and complex characters. Kris, the silent protagonist, serves as the party's leader, while Susie evolves from a school bully into a loyal, axe-wielding powerhouse. They are joined by Ralsei, a kind-hearted "Prince from the Dark" who guides them with his knowledge of the prophecy. Along the way, they encounter memorable antagonists and allies, such as the energetic Prince Lancer, the flamboyant Rouxls Kaard, and the digital monarch Queen.

## Release and Development
The development of *Deltarune* has been a long-term project for Toby Fox, with work beginning as early as 2012. The game is being released in chapters to manage its ambitious scope. Chapter 1 was released for free in 2018, followed by Chapter 2 in 2021. More recently, Chapters 3 and 4 were released in June 2025 as part of the game's first paid installment. Fans continue to look forward to the remaining chapters, which will complete the seven-part saga.
